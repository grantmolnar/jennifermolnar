						But lo! A clarion flame will burn it all!<br>
						The sun will rise with all his potent powers.<br><br>

						Though weighty fortunes rest upon our wings<br>
						To gaze upon the luminescent skies<br>

						I rake the days or leaves into a heap.<br>

						And scarlet thoughts assume a drabber guise.<br><br>

						The Tree of Life is rife with verdure now:<br>
						She wanes anon as Autumn hastens on.<br>
						And though I try, I cannot fathom how<br>
						To keep her green, pristine like Summer's dawn.<br><br>

						Lo! Winter looms, and soon I too shall go<br>

						I passed beside a somber little loch<br>
						And greeted friendly geese and dapper ducks.<br>
						I ventured close and crouched upon a rock...<br>
						And here my short report attains its crux.<br><br>

						A sable creature sliced the waters through,<br>
						With humps like knuckles of a sodden troll.<br>
						Its bulk below the waves was hid from view,<br>
						Approach unchecked by shallows, shelf, or shoal.<br><br>

						No log it was, for logs leave no such wake;<br>
						Nor fowl fair, for fowls have need of air;<br>
						Nor yet a fish, for fish dwell 'neath the lake;<br>
						Nor otter, for no otters shelter there.<br><br>

						The thing arrived, triumphant in its race&mdash;<br>
						Then slipped beneath the black without a trace.<br>

						That patient tears have worn and yet will wear <br>
						Until beneath my hands it feels like bone<br>
						As smooth and soothing as the soul can bear<br><br>

						And what is hope? A hiltless silver knife<br>
						That carves the reckless fist that lifts it up<br>
						Defiant, drunken, drenched in crimson life:<br>
						A giddy wine to fill the victor's cup<br><br>

						If bland despair is anchor to my calm<br>
						While heady hope is twin to bloody fear,<br>
						Why should my soul reject the meeker balm<br>
						And cleave instead to fancies so severe?<br><br>

						As peace is found in loss forevemore<br>
						I cannot help but wage another war<br>
